## Overview

The Logistic System in Liberation provides the opportunity to gather resources from your production sectors without needing to transport them by yourself. This system is a suitable replacement of the old "passive income" option for smaller groups of players.

## Usage

To access the dialog, you need to have at least 2 legit destinations for the logistic system (FOBs and factories). Only the commander can access the dialog and he has to be at a FOB.
