You begin the campaign either onboard the USS Freedom, or at Chimera base, safe zones the enemy won't dare to attack.

Your first choice would be to choose where you want to deploy. At first, you will only be able deploy at your starting position but as you progress, more options will become available such as Forward Operating Bases (FOB) and mobile respawns.

At your starting position you can choose your equipment from a complete Arsenal. You will also find your first FOB packaged inside a container, the Spartan-01 helicopter and a few other small transport helicopters.

You will have to ferry that container with the Spartan-01 (or choose to start with the first FOB already built) and then deploy your first FOB wherever you want (as long as you're 1km from the starting position and 300m from any sector), so it's up to you to choose the right place to start your campaigns offensive.

If you, or anyone on your server, don't have access to the helicopter DLC, you can choose via the mission parameters to start the campaign with the first FOB already built. In that case the FOB will be placed at a random position on campaign start. Then you can decide to use that position or repack the FOB into a container or truck and move it to a place which is more suitable to your liking.
